Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

For cafe, I overloaded restock twice because sometimes you need to restock 
only specific items and not the entire list of items.

House: 
For house I overloaded move in and move out in the effort to create an array that would add new students based on name and id number.

Library :
For library I overloaded library and isavailable; Library was so I would be able 
to condense the content found within library and make it easier for users and for isavailable
was so that we could know whether a specific book can be found or is in a specific library.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found the class lecture helpful on overload and override helpful as well as having access to the 
slides to go back and reference. Something I would recommend for future classes is to possible have a demo video available to students to look back on for overiding so they could watch the step by steps on what goes into the overriding process.
